        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (165g) packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cup (155g) AP flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>220g chocolate chips/chunks</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.</li>
            <li>Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.
            </li>
            <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).</li>
            <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.</li>
            <li>Cool completely before serving (Or not, who am I to tell you not to eat a <em>steaming, melty cookie</em> straight out out of the oven?)</li>
        </ol>
